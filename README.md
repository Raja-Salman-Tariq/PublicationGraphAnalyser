# Publication Graph Analyser

This project simply acquires a massive dataset of publication related information - defining authors, works, collaborations, etc. The dataset is available at the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_-n6eQI-7O9l9F9tHteQAH_CRsqeeUfC/view?usp=sh

In this project, we customize and optimize algorithms such as the Dijkstra as well as datastructures including the Maximum Spanning Trees. We thereby create a custom implementation which parses the above dataset, restructures the information, transforms it into a (simple) graph representation. Finally we use the graph representation with simple analysis techniques in order to find highest collaborative works. The work is constrained to be efficient for which execution time has been used as a metric.

NOTE : this repository needs to be reviewed. It may not have the Publication Graph Analyser code, and instead may have experimental works for the following:
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching Algorithm
- Rabin-Karp String Matching Algorithm
- Automatons / State Machines
